# Intro
- I wish to start by saying that was a challenging and very informative test for me, since I haven't worked on neither medical related data nor real ML datasets, i managed to make a script with the little bit of knowledge i still had from my masters courses, and also some help from chatGPT.
- First step of the the script is to perfom data exploration, and generate some simple graphs and plots in .pdf format.
- The script in python uses the scikit learn library to train and evaluate 2 simple models : Logistic regression(Elastic-Net Multinomial Logistic Regression) and decision trees(HistGradientBoostingClassifier (HGB)).
